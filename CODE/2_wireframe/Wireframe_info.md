# Team 12 - Project
## Web Application Wireframe Information

The wireframe is built using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). The web application is envisions to have 4 pages. 

### 1. Home page
The home page provides a basic overview of the project, team members, data sets used and an abstract. 

### 2. Insights Dashboard
This page shows how the Tableau dashboard (mocked up as a hand sketch) will be embedded in an i-frame in the application. The goal of this dashboard is to provide users an opportunity to learn about the data sets used, find out the trends and insights about the COVID patients data. 

### 3. Model Performance Dashboard
This page will also embed a Tableau dashboard and is intended to provide an overview of the modeling exercise. The team intends to build a prediction model using the CDC data sets to allow users to get a prediction for hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths. The dashboard is shown as a hand sketch.

### 4. Get Predictions
The last page is where users can input feature values and get a prediction. This page of the wireframe shows a mock-up of how that could be laid out. 

The working prototype of this web app wireframe can be seen at this [link](https://www.figma.com/proto/U2cieCsx1zauvFY2QQUfLe/Team12_Wireframe?node-id=36%3A2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A3).
